Checkup uses a `.checkuprc` file to configure the behaviour of the tool. The file is located in the root of the project.

## Configuration file

You can create a configuration file by running the following command:

<Tabs
  groupId='package-manager-flavor'
  defaultValue='npx'
  values={[
    { label: 'npx', value: 'npx' },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value='npx'>

```bash
npx checkup generate config
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn'>

```bash
yarn checkup generate config
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate a .checkuprc file in the current directory, with the following contents:

```json title=".checkuprc"
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkupjs/checkup/master/packages/core/src/schemas/config-schema.json",
  "excludePaths": [],
  "plugins": [],
  "tasks": {}
}
```

### `excludePaths`

You can exclude paths from the analysis by adding them to the `excludePaths` array, which is a comma separated list of paths.

### `plugins`

Plugins can be configured by adding them to the `plugins` array. Each plugin is a string that represents the name of the plugin.

### `tasks`

Tasks can be individually configured by adding them to the `tasks` object. The key is the name of the task, and the value is either a string or a tuple:

Example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkupjs/checkup/master/packages/core/src/schemas/config-schema.json",
  "excludePaths": [],
  "plugins": [],
  "tasks": {
    "plugin-name/my-task": "off",
    "plugin-name/my-other-task": [
      "on",
      {
        "some-option": "some-value"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
