title: Why Checkup?
---

Codebases change over time, which means that the quality of the codebase changes as the project evolves. Keeping up with those changes, and making sure that the quality of the codebase is maintained, is a key part of the development process.

Static analysis has long been a part of the development process. And while the ecosystem of JavaScript static analysis tools is rich and evolving, most of those tools are focused on rule-based, single-file analysis. Getting a picture of the results of multiple tools that combine to give a full representation of the codebase is a challenge. Each tool would need to be run independently, and their results combined and normalized to get a clear picture of the codebase.

This is where Checkup comes in.

Checkup is a static analysis aggregator that produces a single report of the codebase across multiple tools. It uses tasks to run analysis, irrespective of tool, and combines the results into a single report. That report utilizes the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF), which is a standard format for static analysis reports.

## Group Results from Multiple Tools into a Single Report

Most linters and other static analysis tools operate on a single file at a time. Understanding the relationship between results from multiple tools is difficult, or requires custom scripts to be written.

Checkup allows you to take a view from a higher level. It allows you to run multiple tools on a single file, or across groups of files, and then combine the results into a single report. This gives you a different picture of your codebase, and allows you to perform analysis with whole project knowledge.

## Manage API Migrations from Start to Finish

Project maintenance often requires multiple series of API migrations. It's not uncommon to have a large number of API changes that need to be made to a project, which can overlap and be a challenge to track.

Checkup provides a way to quanitfy the changes that need to be made to a project, and to track the progress of those changes. This allows you to gauge the overall effort, and make adjustments to ensure that projects get completed in a timely manner.

## Leverage the Power of Static Analysis Tools

The static analysis ecosystem is rich in JavaScript. While most of the tools are focused on rule-based, single-file analysis, Checkup is able to leverage the power of the tools to provide a more comprehensive view of the codebase.
