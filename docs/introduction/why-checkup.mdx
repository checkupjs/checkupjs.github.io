title: Why Checkup?
---

Codebases change over time, which means that the quality of the codebase changes as the project evolves. Keeping up with those changes, and making sure that the quality of the codebase is maintained, is a key part of the development process.

Static analysis has long been a part of the development process. And while the ecosystem of JavaScript static analysis tools is rich and evolving, most of those tools are focused on rule-based, single-file analysis. Getting a picture of the results of multiple tools that combine to give a full representation of the codebase is a challenge. Each tool would need to be run independently, and their results combined and normalized to get a clear picture of the codebase.

This is where Checkup comes in.

Checkup is a static analysis aggregator that produces a single report of the codebase across multiple tools. It uses tasks to run analysis, irrespective of tool, and combines the results into a single report. That report utilizes the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF), which is a standard format for static analysis reports.

## Group Tasks Into Plugins

Checkup follows a similar approach to other static analysis tools that provide plugin systems to provide extensibility. Tasks are grouped into plugins, which are in turn loaded and run in parallel.

## Author Tasks to Gather Insights

Checkup provides a simple structure to author tasks to gather insights from the codebase. Tasks are written in JavaScript, and can be run alone or as a task in a Checkup plugin.

## Output Tasks into a Standardized Report

Task output is transformed into a standardized report format. This is done by using the [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v1.0/os/sarif-v1.0-os.html) format.

## Leverage the Power of the SARIF Format

SARIF is an emerging standard that provides a consistent, deterministic format for static analysis reports. It adds rich metadata to the report, and provides a standard way to describe the analysis.
